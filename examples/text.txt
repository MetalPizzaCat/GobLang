Programming â€” composition of sequence of instructions,
 called programs,
  that computers can follow to perform tasks.
These programs are used in a wide range of applications in nearly every field.  
A large portion of programming is dedicated to writing and debugging  
source code and majority of programming languages require writing code using text based format.
 However certain programming languages allow developers to express their logic using different methods, 
 such as visual programming languages that use various geometrical shapes to represent the source code.
